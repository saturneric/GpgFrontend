# Gpg Frontend

GpgFrontend is a modern, easy-to-use, compact, cross-platform, and installation-free gpg front-end tool. By using
GpgFrontend, you can quickly **encrypt and decrypt text or files**. Or at the same time as the above operations, you can
add
**your own signature** to let others know that this document or this paragraph of text was issued by you.

Furthermore, it visualizes most of the common operations of gpg commands. It aims to allow ordinary users to quickly use
gpg and make professional users more convenient. GpgFrontend supports some new features of OpenPGP.

      gnupg.

## Purpose

The GpgFrontend project inherit from a relatively mature but not maintained gpg4usb project. It inherits the stable,
easy-to-use, compact, and installation-free features of gpg4usb, and plans to support some new features of OpenPGP based
on it and continue to improve it.

GpgFrontend will add more functions in the future to improve the ease of use of GPG in end-to-end transmission. At the
same time, the addition of new functions does not affect the old basic functions. My personal strength is always
limited. GpgFrontend welcomes volunteers to join. You can use the GitHub platform to file an issue, or submit a pull
request.

The GpgFrontend project is as open source, and it also insists on using open source codes and libraries.

## How to Build it

The tutorial for building the software will be released shortly.

## Contract
