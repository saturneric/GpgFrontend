## Modules

GpgFrontend supports extensive module development, allowing users to customize
their experience. Modules can encapsulate functionality, enabling users to
enable or disable features as needed. Users can refer to existing module code
for guidance and are encouraged to contribute to the [Module
Repository](https://github.com/saturneric/GpgFrontend-Modules.git) to reach a
broader audience.

As the development is still in its infancy, there are not enough modules and
many API interfaces have not been stabilized. So the discussion is open for the
development of new modules and the introduction of API interfaces.
