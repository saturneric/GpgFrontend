# Translate Interface

GpgFrontend is designed to support multiple languages, but requires volunteer contributions to achieve this goal.
Fortunately, translation work does not require an understanding of difficult technology. Volunteers only need to move
their fingers to complete.

There are two ways to translate, through a translation tool with a GUI interface or directly through a text editor.

## What you need to know about translation work

From v2.0.1, Gpg Frontend uses the popular translation support
library [GNU gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) in the GNU project. Before starting everything, you need to
know something about this library. After you are sure about the content of the document, you can first try to see how
GpgFrontned uses the tools provided by this library.

### Facts

Most of the translation work is carried out by Google Translate. In most cases, what you have to do is to correct some
of the bad aspects of Google Translate.
