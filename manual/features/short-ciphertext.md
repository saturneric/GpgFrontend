# Short Cipher-text

**NOTICE: As of version 2.0.0, GpgFrontend has eliminated this feature.**

The short ciphertext function allows OpenPGP to transfer ciphertext quickly and conveniently in instant messaging software.
After successfully configuring the own key and obtaining the Service Token, you can use the short cipher text function.

After the encryption and signature operations, you can click the short crypto button in the additional operations menu. 
GpgFrontend will return a very short ciphertext, and you can publish the short ciphertext anywhere.

You can paste the ciphertext into the text tab of GpgFrontend and select decryption and verification operations. 
At this time, GpgFrontend will perform the corresponding operations.

Note: The short ciphertext is valid within seven days of being generated. The short ciphertext function has restrictions on the length of the ciphertext.
