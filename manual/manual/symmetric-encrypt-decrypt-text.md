# Symmetric Encrypt & Decrypt Text

Symmetric encryption will be triggered when you click the Encrypt button and do
not check any key in the Key Toolbox. For symmetric encryption, you need to set
a password for your encryption process. When decrypting, you need to enter the
same password as the encryption process.
