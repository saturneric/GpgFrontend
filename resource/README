ABOUT
-----
gpg4usb is an easy to use, small portable editor with the possibility
to encrypt and decrypt any text-message or -file you want. For encryption it acts as
a gpg-frontend (http://gnupg.org/). Its intend is to be used from an usb-stick,
running on Windows(TM) and Linux. Providing a mac-binary is on our TODO-list.

Our aim is, to give anyone the possibility to send and receive secure encrypted
messages anywhere - on any computer out there, no matter if Microsoft Windows(TM)
or Linux is running on it. Therefore it's usage should be self-describing, and the
user-interface is kept as simple as possible.

Of course gpg4usb is open source, as are included libs and binaries.
